# Recognizing Hand-written 

Images of hand-written digits are analyzed and classified. Principal component analysis (PCA) is performed on the images using Scikit-learn, as a feature reduction method. An unsupervised learning is performed using K-Mean clustering algorithm to classify the images into 10 categories, representing digits 0-9.
