# Data Science Portfolio

Data science projects that I have completed for self-learning purpose. The projects are chosen to cover the important concepts of data science, including data collection, data cleaning, visualization, machine learning, and statistical method.

Technical tools such as Python libraries (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn) are used in these projects.
