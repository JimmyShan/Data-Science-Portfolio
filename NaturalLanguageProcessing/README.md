# Natural Language Processing

This project is based on the Kaggle competition, "Yelp Business Rating Prediction". In this project, Yelp reviews are classified into star ratings based on the text contents of the reviews.

A Naive Bayes classification model is built using CountVectorizer, TF-IDF transformer, and sklearn Pipeline, and the performance of the model is evaluated using confusion matrix and classification report.
