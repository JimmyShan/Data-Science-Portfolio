# NYC Apartment Rent Prediction
Prediction models are built for apartment rent in NYC using RandomForest and GradientBoosting regression. Two regression models are compared using statistical method. The dataset is collected by web scraping and cleaned using Pandas. Exploratory analysis is presented using Seaborn.

## Introduction
Housing is expansive in big cities like New York and Bay Area, and there are many factors to consider when renting or leasing an apartment. So it is important to come up with a good way to determine apartment rent based on its features such as location, size, and quality of the apartment.

Typically, this is done by human experience and intelligent. In this project, prediction models are built for apartment rent in NYC, and the performances of two regression models are studied.
